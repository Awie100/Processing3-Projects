# Processing 3 Projects
This is a repo of all of my processing 3 projects, notable projects include:
* cars - An implemantation of a genetic algorithm with the goal of making car objects drive along a track across the screen in the fastest time
* carsnotime - Same as cars but not tied to the framerate of the device and thus much faster
* generation - A stack based maze generator
* generationGrid - Same as generation but with functionality to output the maze as a string of a 2d grid of boolean values in processing format
* pathfinder - A fork of generation that implements agents to solve the generated maze in real time
* doomMe - An implementation of the 2d map to 3d view system that older games like Doom used to display their maps
